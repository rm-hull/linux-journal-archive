    In the first issue of <i  >Linux Journal</i> we interviewed Linux
    Torvarlds. In this issue we interview Patrick Vokerding,
    the author of &ldquo;Slackware&rdquo;, one of the most popular Linux
    distributions.

you. How old are you?
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Pat:</b></span> I'm 27.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>Linux Journal</i>:</b></span> What you do
for work, school, etc?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Pat:</b></span> For school, well.... I
finally got my BS in computer science from Moorhead State
University last Spring. On the 8 year plan, actually. I started out
in computer engineering at Boston University in `85, did that for 2
years, and then took a year off before transferring into the CS
program at MSU.</p><p>I just recently got a job for a San Francisco-based company
making medical archiving systems controlled by Linux boxes. It's
been pretty interesting work.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>Linux Journal</i>:</b></span> I am looking
for articles on the commercial use of Linux. I would be real
interested in an article on what you are doing there.</p><p>What you do for fun?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Pat:</b></span> I do all kinds of
things for fun. Linux is my big fun project right now - gets pretty
crazy sometimes trying to keep up with all of the development going
on; for instance, last week the new C libraries, GCC, and kernel
were all released within a couple days of each other. Luckily, I
like keeping my machine current. Judging from the mail I get when
things fall a bit behind, so does everyone else.</p><p>Hmmmmm.... other things? Well, I like to brew my own beer.
That was my big hobby until Linux began to demand more of my time.
It's a fun process. My favorite part is firing up my 140K BTU
burner and boiling it up for an hour or so. The aroma it releases
when you throw the hops into the rolling boil is magnificent! The
Homebrew Digest and rec.crafts.brewing were my big Internet
hangouts before I came across Linux.</p><p>I also love music, especially the Grateful Dead. I've gone
to, oh... 75 or so of their shows. The summers of `87 and `88 I
followed the band all over the US in my `67 Firebird convertible.
I've also got lots of portable recording equipment and tape the
shows whenever I can. The Dead let their fans do this, which is
pretty unique in the music world.</p><p>I play guitar, too. I'm still waiting for Jerry [Garcia] to
invite me up on stage. :^)</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>Linux Journal</i>:</b></span> Another
DeadHead? I've only gone to 30 or 40 shows. My first show was in
1974 and I have around 100 tapes from shows.</p><p>Now, on to the real stuff.</p><p>When did you first start working with computers?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Pat:</b></span> Way back in 1973 when I
was just a kid, I went on a field trip with my class to the
computer department at North Dakota State University. The room
where they kept the machines totally amazed me - lots of big
whirring machines with flashing lights all over the place and rows
of those big drives with disk platters. One of the sysops showed me
how to play Star Trek on a DecWriter teletype-style terminal. It
was an instantaneous addiction.</p><p>At the time, though, there was no way I could get a home
computer. I don't even think such things existed, so I started
getting interested in electronics, which was more accessible. I'd
build logic gates out of relays and things like that. When the
first personal computers like the TRS-80, Apple ][, and Atari
400/800 came out, I became a fixture in many of the stores that
sold them. I couldn't afford one, but the store owners would let me
hang out and use their machines. I taught myself BASIC and would
write little store demo programs to ensure I'd stay welcome
there.</p><p>I got an Apple ][ Plus with a 300 baud AppleCat modem right
around 1980, when it was the hot machine. I used Apple as my only
computer right up until 1990. I even had a C compiler and Unix-like
operating system for it. It was nothing even resembling Linux,
though.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>Linux Journal</i>:</b></span> When did you
first start working with Linux? Pat: I first heard about Linux in
late 1992 from a friend named Wes at a party in Fargo, North
Dakota. I didn't download it right away, but when I needed to find
a LISP interpreter for a project at school, I remembered seeing
people mention clisp ran on Linux. So, I ended up downloading one
of the versions of Peter MacDonald's SLS distribution. <i  >Linux Journal</i>: Describe what Slackware is?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Pat:</b></span> Well, I guess I can
assume we all know what Linux is. :^) Slackware consists of a basic
Linux system (the kernel, shared libraries, and basic utilities),
and a number of optional software packages such as the GNU C and
C++ compilers, networking and mail handling software, and the X
window system.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>Linux Journal</i>:</b></span> Why did you
decide to do a distribution?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Pat:</b></span> That's a good one. I
never really did decide to do a distribution. What happened was
that my AI professor wanted me to show him how to install Linux so
that he could use it on his machine at home, and share it with some
graduate students who were also doing a lot of work in LISP. So, we
went into the PC lab and installed the SLS version of Linux.</p><p>Having dealt with Linux for a few weeks, I'd put together a
pile of notes describing all the little things that needed to be
fixed after the main installation was complete. After spending
nearly as much time going through the list and reconfiguring
whatever needed it as we had putting the software on the machine in
the first place, my professor looked at me and said, &ldquo;Is there some
way we can fix the install disks so that new machines will have
these fixes right away?&rdquo;. That was the start of the project. I
changed parts of the original SLS installation scripts, fixing some
bugs and adding a feature that installed important packages like
the shared libraries and the kernel image automatically.</p><p>I also edited the description files on the installation disks
to make them more informative. Most importantly, I went through the
software packages, fixing any problems I found. Most of the
packages worked perfectly well, but some needed help. The mail,
networking, and uucp software had a number of incorrect file
permissions that prevented it from functioning out of the box. Some
applications would coredump without any explanation&mdash;for those I'd
go out looking for source code on the net. SLS only came with
source code for a small amount of the distribution, but often there
would be new versions out anyway, so I'd grab the source for those
and port them over. When I started on the task, I think the Linux
kernel was at around 0.98pl4 (someone else may remember that better
than I do...), and I put together improved SLS releases for my
professor through version 0.99pl9. By this time I'd gotten ahead of
SLS on maybe half of the packages in the distribution, and had done
some reconfiguration on most of the remaining half. I'd done some
coding myself to fix long-standing problems like a finger bug that
would say users had `Never logged in' whenever they weren't online.
The difference between SLS and Slackware was starting to be more
than just cosmetic.</p><p>In May, or maybe as late as June of `93, I'd brought my own
distribution up to the 4.4.1 C libraries and Linux kernel
0.99pl11A. This brought significant improvements to the networking
and really seemed to stabilize the system. My friends at MSU
thought it was great and urged me to put it up for FTP. I thought
for sure SLS would be putting out a new version that included these
things soon enough, so I held off for a few weeks. During this time
I saw a lot of people asking on the net when there would be a
release that included some of these new things, so I made a post
entitled &ldquo;Anyone want an SLS-like 0.99pl11A system?&rdquo; I got a
tremendous response to the post.</p><p>After talking with the local sysadmin at MSU, I got
permission to open an anonymous FTP server on one of the machines -
an old 3b2. I made an announcement and watched with horror as
multitudes of FTP connections crashed the 3b2 over, and over, and
over. Those who did get copies of the 1.00 Slackware release did
say some nice things about it on the net. My archive space problems
didn't last long, either. Some people associated with Walnut Creek
CDROM (and ironically enough, members of the 386BSD core group)
offered me the current archive space on ftp.cdrom.com.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>Linux Journal</i>:</b></span> Why did you
call it Slackware?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Pat:</b></span> My friend J.R. &ldquo;Bob&rdquo;
Dobbs suggested it. ;^) Although I've seen people say that it
carries negative connotations, I've grown to like the name. It's
what I started calling it back when it was really just a hacked
version of SLS and I had no intention of putting it up for public
retrieval. When I finally did put it up for FTP, I kept the name. I
think I named it &ldquo;Slackware&rdquo; because I didn't want people to take
it all that seriously at first.</p><p>It's a big responsibility setting up software for possibly
thousands of people to use (and find bugs in). Besides, I think it
sounds better than &ldquo;Microsoft&rdquo;, don't you?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>Linux Journal</i>:</b></span> Some of the
people out here in Seattle call them MicroSquish. :-) I admit that
I initially avoided going from SLS to Slackware because I didn't
take the name seriously. But the feedback I heard on the Internet
pointed out why I should take it seriously. What did you expect to
happen with the distribution?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Pat:</b></span> I never planned for it
to last as long as it has. I thought Peter MacDonald (of SLS) would
take a look at what I was doing and would fix the problems with
SLS. Instead, he claimed distribution rights on the Slackware
install scripts since they were derived from ones included in SLS.
I was allowed to keep what I had up for FTP, but told Peter I
wouldn't make other changes to Slackware until I'd written new
installation scripts to replace the ones that came from SLS. I
wrote the new scripts, and after putting that much work into things
I wasn't going to give up. I did everything I could to make
Slackware the distribution of choice, integrating new software and
upgrades into the release as fast as they came out. It's a lot of
work, and sometimes I wonder how long I can go on for.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>Linux Journal</i>:</b></span> What sort of
help have you received?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Pat:</b></span> Most recently, Savio
Lam wrote the dialog program used to create the color installation
menus on the latest release of Slackware (1.1.2). Ian Kluft put the
smail package together for me. Vince Shakan's newspak collection of
configuration scripts were very useful for compiling applications
like elm and Taylor UUCP. Louis LaBash just contributed a kit to
compile a version of perl with working IPC. Early on, Allen Gwinn
sent me the lpd package. All the users that send me bug reports
helped a lot, too. I especially like when they don't flame me too
severely in the process.</p><p>Other than a few key packages from development teams that I
trust, like GNU GCC from H.J. Lu, or the XFree86 2.0 package, I
compile nearly all of the software myself. There are still a few
remaining bits of SLS in the package - you can spot them by looking
for files with 1992 time stamps.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>Linux Journal</i>:</b></span> Do you have
any idea of the number of copies of Slackware that might be in use
today?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Pat:</b></span> Thousands, but it would
be hard to estimate an exact count. I have no idea how many CDs
have been pressed with Slackware on them, but I can think of four
companies that have produced them. Harald T. Alvestrand, who is
attempting to count Linux users, posted this estimate: I don't
claim that these numbers are in any way unbiased. They are just the
240 machine descriptions that have arrived at the counter.
Obviously, they give a slight bias towards net-oriented
releases.</p><p><a href="2750s1.html" target="_self">See table</a></p><p>Of the seven &ldquo;unknown&rdquo; ones, two were misspellings of
slackware. There are biases in the summing too; one who listed
&ldquo;slackware, sls&rdquo; got only the &ldquo;slackware&rdquo; part counted. At least,
it is a datum.</p><p>(Now for some wild speculation: If this is average, and 8000
LGX CDs have been sold, and 9 of them turn up here, that would mean
that I have a return rate of 0.11 percent on LGX users. A similar
return rate on the others would mean 218,000 machines in the Linux
installed base. My statistics professor would flunk me for
extrapolation.....)</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>Linux Journal</i>:</b></span> Does
Slackware have a future?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Pat:</b></span> I would like to think
so. I really enjoy working with Linux, and have had a blast making
a complete package like Slackware available and easy enough for
beginners to install. Ian Murdock (of the Debian distribution) and
I have tossed around the idea of a merger since last fall. It's
possible that this could eventually happen.</p><p>At this point, I've got some nice scripts that create
packages, including the installation scripts that create the
symbolic links. Other than answering my mail, it's not that hard to
keep Slackware up to date. If I'm going to bother to keep my own
machine current, I might as well be updating the packages on the
FTP site at the same time.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>Linux Journal</i>:</b></span> Do you
want/expect any commercial benefit from Slackware?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Pat:</b></span> I haven't accepted any
so far. It would be nice to make money as a result of it, but not
from selling the actual package. I'm not interested in going into
the mail-order CD-ROM business or anything like that, but my
experience with Linux has taught me a lot of valuable skills. It
looks like the project has saved me from a life of COBOL. What more
could I ask for than that?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>Linux Journal</i>:</b></span> Thanks for
doing this. I think the readers are going to be real interested in
this monthly interview column and I really want to get people from
all walks of the Linux world interviewed.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Pat:</b></span> Sure!</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2750f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
