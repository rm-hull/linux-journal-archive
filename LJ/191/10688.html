What do you do when you get an alert that your system load is high?
Tracking down the cause of high load just takes some time, some experience
and a few Linux tools.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x169b580.0x1793408"></a></h2></div></div><p>
This column is the first in a series of columns dedicated to one of
my favorite subjects: troubleshooting. I'm a systems administrator during
the day, and although I enjoy many aspects of my job, it's hard to beat the
adrenaline rush of tracking down a complex server problem when downtime is
being measured in dollars. Although it's true that there are about as many
different reasons for downtime as there are Linux text editors, and just
as many approaches to troubleshooting, over the years, I've found I
perform the same sorts of steps to isolate a problem. Because my column
is generally aimed more at tips and tricks and less on philosophy and
design, I'm not going to talk much about overall approaches to problem
solving. Instead, in this series I describe some general
classes of problems you might find on a Linux system, and then I
discuss how to use common tools, most of which probably are already on
your system, to isolate and resolve each class of problem.
</p><p>
For this first column, I start with one of the most common
problems you will run into on a Linux system. No, it's not getting printing
to work. I'm talking about a sluggish server that might have high
load. Before I explain how to diagnose and fix high load though,
let's take a step back and discuss what load means on a Linux machine
and how to know when it's high.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x169b580.0x1793618"></a>
Uptime and Load</h2></div></div><p>
When administrators mention high load, generally they are talking
about the <span   class="emphasis"><em>load average</em></span>. When I diagnose why a server
is slow, the first command I run when I log in to the system is uptime:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ uptime
 18:30:35 up 365 days, 5:29, 2 users, load average: 1.37, 10.15, 8.10
</pre>
</p><p>
As you can see, it's my server's uptime birthday today. You also can see
that my load average is <tt  >1.37, 10.15, 8.10</tt>. These numbers
represent my average system load during the last 1, 5 and 15 minutes,
respectively. Technically speaking, the load average represents the
average number of processes that have to wait for CPU time during the
last 1, 5 or 15 minutes. For instance, if I have a current load of 0,
the system is completely idle. If I have a load of 1, the CPU is busy
enough that one process is having to wait for CPU time. If I do have a
load of 1 and then spawn another process that normally would tie up a
CPU, my load should go to 2. With a load average, the system will give
you a good idea of how consistently busy it has been over the past 1,
5 and 10 minutes.
</p><p>
Another important thing to keep in mind when you look at a load average
is that it isn't normalized according to the number of CPUs on your
system. Generally speaking, a consistent load of 1 means one CPU on the
system is tied up. In simplified terms, this means that a single-CPU
system with a load of 1 is roughly as busy as a four-CPU system with a
load of 4. So in my above example, let's assume that I have a single-CPU
system. If I were to log in and see the above load average, I'd probably
assume that the server had pretty high load (8.10) during the last 15
minutes that spiked around 5 minutes ago (10.15), but recently, at least
during the last 1 minute, the load has dropped significantly. If I saw
this, I might even assume that the real cause of the load has subsided. On
the other hand, if the load averages were 20.68, 5.01, 1.03, I would
conclude that the high load had likely started in the last 5 minutes
and was getting worse.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x169b580.0x1793930"></a>
How High Is High?</h2></div></div><p>
After you understand what load average means, the next logical question
is &ldquo;What load average is good and what is bad?&rdquo; The answer to that is
&ldquo;It depends.&rdquo; You see, a lot of different things can cause
load to be high, each of which affects performance differently. One server
might have a load of 50 and still be pretty responsive, while another
server might have a load of 10 and take forever to log in to. I've had
servers with load averages in the hundreds that were certainly slow,
but didn't crash, and I had one server that consistently had a load of
50 that was still pretty responsive and stayed up for years.
</p><p>
What really matters when you troubleshoot a system with high load is
<span   class="emphasis"><em>why</em></span> the load is high. When you start to diagnose high
load, you
find that most load seems to fall into three categories: CPU-bound load,
load caused by out of memory issues and I/O-bound load. I explain
each of these categories in detail below and how to use tools like top
and iostat to isolate the root cause.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x169b580.0x1793bf0"></a>
top</h2></div></div><p>
If the first tool I use when I log in to a sluggish system is uptime, the
second tool I use is top. The great thing about top is that it's available
for all major Linux systems, and it provides a lot of useful information
in a single screen. top is a quite complex tool with many options
that could warrant its own article. For this column, I stick to
how to interpret its output to diagnose high load.
</p><p>
To use top, simply type <tt  >top</tt> on the command line. By
default, top will run in
interactive mode and update its output every few seconds. Listing 1 shows sample
top output from a terminal.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x169b580.0x1793e00"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Listing 1. Sample top Output</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">

As you can see, there's a lot of information in only a few lines. The
first line mirrors the information you would get from the uptime command
and will update every few seconds with the latest load averages. In this
case, you can see my system is busy, but not what I would call heavily
loaded. All the same, this output breaks down well into our different
load categories. When I troubleshoot a sluggish system, I generally will
rule out CPU-bound load, then RAM issues, then finally I/O issues in
that order, so let's start with CPU-bound load.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x169b580.0x1794068"></a>
CPU-Bound Load</h2></div></div><p>
CPU-bound load is load caused when you have too many CPU-intensive
processes running at once. Because each process needs CPU resources,
they all must wait their turn. To check whether load is CPU-bound,
check the CPU line in the top output:


<pre     class="programlisting">
Cpu(s): 11.4%us, 29.6%sy, 0.0%ni, 58.3%id, .7%wa, 0.0%hi, 0.0%si, 0.0%st
</pre>
</p><p>
Each of these percentages are a percentage of the CPU time tied up doing
a particular task. Again, you could spend an entire column on all of
the output from top, so here's a few of these values 
and how to read them:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
us: user CPU time. More often than not, when you have CPU-bound load,
it's due to a process run by a user on the system, such as Apache, MySQL
or maybe a shell script. If this percentage is high, a user process
such as those is a likely cause of the load.
</p></li><li><p>
sy: system CPU time. The system CPU time is the percentage of the
CPU tied up by kernel and other system processes. CPU-bound load 
should manifest either as a high percentage of user or high system CPU time.
</p></li><li><p>
id: CPU idle time. This is the percentage of the time that the CPU
spends idle. The higher the number here the better! In fact, if you see
really high CPU idle time, it's a good indication that any high load is
not CPU-bound.
</p></li><li><p>
wa: I/O wait. The I/O wait value tells the percentage of time the
CPU is spending waiting on I/O (typically disk I/O). If you have high
load and this value is high, it's likely the load is not CPU-bound
but is due to either RAM issues or high disk I/O.
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x169b580.0x1794590"></a>
Track Down CPU-Bound Load</h2></div></div><p>
If you do see a high percentage in the user or system columns, there's
a good chance your load is CPU-bound. To track down the root cause,
skip down a few lines to where top displays a list of current processes
running on the system. By default, top will sort these based on the
percentage of CPU used with the processes using the most on top (Listing
2).

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x169b580.0x17946f0"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Listing 2. Current Processes Example</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">
  PID USER   PR NI  VIRT  RES  SHR S %CPU %MEM    TIME+  COMMAND
 9463 mysql  16  0  686m 111m 3328 S   53  5.5 569:17.64 mysqld
18749 nagios 16  0  140m 134m 1868 S   12  6.6   1345:01 nagios2db_status
24636 nagios 17  0 34660  10m  712 S    8  0.5   1195:15 nagios
22442 nagios 24  0  6048 2024 1452 S    8  0.1   0:00.04 check_time.pl
</pre></div><p>
The %CPU column tells you just how much CPU each process is taking
up. In this case, you can see that MySQL is taking up 53% of my CPU. As
you look at this output during CPU-bound load, you probably will see
one of two things: either you will have a single process tying up 99%
of your CPU, or you will see a number of smaller processes all fighting
for a percentage of CPU time. In either case, it's relatively simple to
see the processes that are causing the problem. There's one final note
I want to add on CPU-bound load: I've seen systems get incredibly high
load simply because a multithreaded program spawned a huge number of
threads on a system without many CPUs. If you spawn 20 threads on a
single-CPU system, you might see a high load average, even though there
are no particular processes that seem to tie up CPU time.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x169b580.0x17949b0"></a>
Out of RAM Issues</h2></div></div><p>
The next cause for high load is a system that has run out of available
RAM and has started to go into swap. Because swap space is usually on a
hard drive that is much slower than RAM, when you use up available RAM
and go into swap, each process slows down dramatically as the disk gets
used. Usually this causes a downward spiral as processes that have been
swapped run slower, take longer to respond and cause more processes
to stack up until the system either runs out of RAM or slows down to an
absolute crawl. What's tricky about swap issues is that because they hit
the disk so hard, it's easy to misdiagnose them as I/O-bound load. After
all, if your disk is being used as RAM, any processes that actually
want to access files on the disk are going to have to wait in line. So,
if I see high I/O wait in the CPU row in top, I check RAM next and rule
it out before I troubleshoot any other I/O issues.
</p><p>
When I want to diagnose out of memory issues, the first place I look is
the next couple of lines in the top output:


<pre     class="programlisting">
Mem: 1024176k total, 997408k used, 26768k free, 85520k buffers
Swap: 1004052k total, 4360k used, 999692k free, 286040k cached
</pre>
</p><p>
These lines tell you the total amount of RAM and swap along with how
much is used and free; however, look carefully, as these numbers can be
misleading. I've seen many new and even experienced administrators who would look
at the above output and conclude the system was almost out of RAM
because there was only 26768k free. Although that does show how much RAM is
currently unused, it doesn't tell the full story.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x169b580.0x1794c18"></a>
The Linux File Cache</h2></div></div><p>
When you access a file and the Linux kernel loads it into RAM,
the kernel doesn't necessarily unload the file when you no longer need
it. If there is enough free RAM available, the kernel tries to cache as
many files as it can into RAM. That way, if you access the file a second
time, the kernel can retrieve it from RAM instead of the disk and give much
better performance. As a system stays running, you will find the free RAM
actually will appear to get rather small. If a process needs more RAM
though, the kernel simply uses some of its file cache. In fact, I see a
lot of the overclocking crowd who want to improve performance and create
a ramdisk to store their files. What they don't realize is that more
often than not, if they just let the kernel do the work for them, they'd
probably see much better results and make more efficient use of their RAM.
</p><p>
To get a more accurate amount of free RAM, you need to combine the values
from the free column with the cached column. In my example, I would have
26768k + 286040k, or over 300Mb of free RAM. In this case, I could safely
assume my system was not experiencing an out of RAM issue. Of course,
even a system that has very little free RAM may not have gone into
swap. That's why you also must check the Swap: line and see if a high
proportion of your swap is being used.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x169b580.0x178b608"></a>
Track Down High RAM Usage</h2></div></div><p>
If you do find you are low on free RAM, go back to the same process
output from top, only this time, look in the %MEM column. By default,
top will sort by the %CPU column, so simply type M and it will re-sort to
show you which processes are using the highest percentage of RAM. In the
output in Listing 3, I sorted the same processes by RAM, and you can see that
the nagios2db_status process is using the most at 6.6%.

I/O-Bound Load</h2></div></div><p>
I/O-bound load can be tricky to track down sometimes. As I mentioned
earlier, if your system is swapping, it can make the load appear to be
I/O-bound. Once you rule out swapping though, if you do have a high I/O
wait, the next step is to attempt to track down which disk and partition
is getting the bulk of the I/O traffic. To do this, you need a tool
like iostat.
</p><p>
The iostat tool, like top, is a complicated and full-featured tool that
could fill up its own article. Unlike top, although it should be available
for your distribution, it may not be installed on your system by default,
so you need to track down which package provides it. Under Red Hat and
Debian-based systems, you can get it in the sysstat package. Once it's
installed, simply run iostat with no arguments to get a good overall view
of your disk I/O statistics:


<pre     class="programlisting">
Linux 2.6.24-19-server (hostname) 	01/31/2009

avg-cpu:  %user   %nice %system %iowait  %steal   %idle

Device:    tps  Blk_read/s  Blk_wrtn/s   Blk_read   Blk_wrtn
sda       9.82       417.96        27.53   30227262    1990625
sda1      6.55       219.10         7.12   15845129     515216
sda2      0.04         0.74         3.31      53506     239328
sda3      3.24       198.12        17.09   14328323    1236081
</pre>
</p><p>
Like with top, iostat gives you the CPU percentage output. Below
that, it provides a breakdown of each drive and partition on your
system and statistics for each:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
tps: transactions per second.
</p></li><li><p>
Blk_read/s: blocks read per second.
</p></li><li><p>
Blk_wrtn/s: blocks written per second.
</p></li><li><p>
Blk_read: total blocks read.
</p></li><li><p>
Blk_wrtn: total blocks written.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
By looking at these different values and comparing them to each other,
ideally you will be able to find out first, which partition (or partitions)
is getting the bulk of the I/O traffic, and second, whether the majority
of that traffic is reads (Blk_read/s) or writes (Blk_wrtn/s). As I said,
tracking down the cause of I/O issues can be tricky, but hopefully, those
values will help you isolate what processes might be causing the load.
</p><p>
For instance, if you have an I/O-bound load and you suspect that your
remote backup job might be the culprit, compare the read and write
statistics. Because you know that a remote backup job is primarily going
to read from your disk, if you see that the majority of the disk I/O is
writes, you reasonably can assume it's not from the backup job. If, on
the other hand, you do see a heavy amount of read I/O on a particular
partition, you might run the lsof command and grep for that backup
process and see whether it does in fact have some open file handles on
that partition.
</p><p>
As you can see, tracking down I/O issues with iostat is not
straightforward. Even with no arguments, it can take some time and experience
to make sense of the output. That said, iostat does have a number of
arguments you can use to get more information about different types of
I/O, including modes to find details about NFS shares.
Check out the man page for iostat if you want to know more.
</p><p>
Up until recently, tools like iostat were about the limit systems
administrators had in their toolboxes for tracking down I/O issues, but
due to recent developments in the kernel, it has become easier to find
the causes of I/O on a per-process level. If you have a relatively
new system, check out the iotop tool. Like with iostat, it may not be
installed by default, but as the name implies, it essentially acts like
top, only for disk I/O. In Listing 4, you can see that an rsync
process on this machine is using the most I/O (in this case, read I/O).

Once You Track Down the Culprit</h2></div></div><p>
How you deal with these load-causing processes is up to you and depends
on a lot of factors. In some cases, you might have a script that has gone
out of control and is something you can easily kill. In other situations, such
as in the case of a database process, it might not be safe simply to 
kill the process, because it could leave corrupted data behind. Plus, it
could just be that your service is running out of capacity, and the real
solution is either to add more resources to your current server or add
more servers to share the load. It might even be load from a one-time job
that is running on the machine and shouldn't impact load in the future,
so you just can let the process complete. Because so many different things
can cause processes to tie up server resources, it's hard to list them
all here, but hopefully, being able to identify the causes of your high
load will put you on the right track the next time you get an alert that
a machine is slow.
