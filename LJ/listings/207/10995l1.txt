Listing 1. Code to Send Command Output to Mojolicious and Display It
as a Web App

#!/usr/bin/env perl

use Mojolicious::Lite;

# Grab the command line variables
# by accessing the @ARGV array
my $my_url = $ARGV[0]; # The first is the url parameter
my $my_command = $ARGV[1]; # The second is the command

# We need two threads: one for screen and the other
# for Mojolicious and our web page.
my $childpid = fork();

if ($childpid) { # If this is the child thread

   # Send the command to the shell as a parameter of screen
   `screen -L $my_command`;

   # I want mojo to continue running after the child
   # is done. So just give a little reminder to kill it.
   print "Done...\n";
   print "Don't forget to kill the process 'kill -9 $childpid'\n";

} else { # If not, this is the parent thread

   get $my_url => sub { # Set the url to $my_url
       my $self = shift; # Grab the current instance

       # Open the log file and store it in <FILE>
       open(FILE,"html_gobble.log");

       # Create an empty array that will hold all our content
       my @new_file = ();

       # In web land, you need a <br> tag to end a line
       # or encase the line in <div> tags. Let's do the latter.
       # There are tag generating tools in Mojolicious, but let's
       # do it the old-fashioned way.
       #
       # Use perl's "magic open" to open and run through
       # each line of the file.
       while (<FILE>) {
           # The $_ variable holds the current line
           chomp $_; # Remove the newline character
           $_ =~ s/^/<div>/; # add <div> to the beginning
           $_ =~ s/$/<\/div>/; # add </div> to the end
           push(@new_file, $_); # add the line to our array
       }

       # Flatten the array into one long string with no spaces or
       # newline characters.
       my $one_string = join('',@new_file);

       # Tell Mojo to render the index template below
       # and pass our data "$one_string" as a new
       # variable called "$log_data"
       $self->render('index', log_data => $one_string);
   };

   # Start Mojolicious with the lightweight web server
   app->start('daemon');
}
